# Havel_Hakimi_alg
A solution to the Havel/Hakimi detectives problem.

The problem starts that 2 detectives arrive on the scene of a crime with a number of witnesses to the crime itself. They are each asked how many other people they knew from the group of witnesses before this point in time. They give a number of people they knew, and this has to be checked against the other answers given by the other witnesses. The program I wrote takes that list of each witness and how many people they knew and determines if the numbers given could logically work.
